// LinkedList vs ArrayList
// - LinkedLists do not have indexes
// - LinkedLists are not stored contiguously(define: sharing a common border/touching) -> they are spread out in memory

// Head -> points to the first node
// Tail -> points to the last node
// Final pointer in a list points to nothing (null)
