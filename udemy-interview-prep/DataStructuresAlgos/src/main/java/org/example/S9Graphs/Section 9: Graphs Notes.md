## Graphs 

Vertex (aka Node)

Edge 
- connections between vertices
- no limit to the number of vertices a vertex can connect to 
- weighted edges
  - (case? -> something like Google Maps, where a route may be shorter but has heavier traffic)
  - (also network routing protocols)
- can be directional or bidirectional 

## Ways to represent a graph

### Adjacency Matrix 
- if edges are weighted then they should be stored in the matrix as that value rather than a 1 

### Adjacency List
