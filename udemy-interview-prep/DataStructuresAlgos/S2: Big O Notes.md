# Big O

#### A way of comparing 2 sets of code.
- Mathematically comparing two sets of code to determine which is more efficient.

### Time Complexity
- not measured in time 
  - (2 different computers may have different setup and allow for the code to run faster on one then the other)
- Number of operators it takes to complete something
### Space Complexity 
- how much memory does it take up? 
- if memory is an issue it may be better it your code has lower memory complexity and a higher time complexity. 

#### May see greek letter to denote complexity 
Think of a for loop where you have to loop through 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

- Omega 
  - best case = Omega = 1
- Theta
  - average case = 4
- Omicron (O - aka big O)
  - worst case  = 7

### O(n)
- O of n
