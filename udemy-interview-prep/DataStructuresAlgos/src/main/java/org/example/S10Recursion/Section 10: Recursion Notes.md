## Recursion 

A method that calls itself until it stops calling itself. 

- Recursive method is the same each time, 
  - each time you call the recursive method the problem gets smaller and smaller 
  - return statement (a way to break out of the loop is essential)

Base case 
- last case scenario -> some way to break out of the loop 

## Call Stack 
- code runs from bottom to top one method at a time. 

## Factorial 
- use recursion to solve a factorial
